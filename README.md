# Set up a pyomo environment in windows

Installs `glpk`, `ipopt`and `cbc` solvers in a windows environment

## Install

In your environment, install pyomo_environment with
```commandline
pip install pyomo_environment
```

## Use solvers
Create your pyomo model and before executing it, call `get_solver` to get the desired solver.
Example:

```python
# Create model normally
import pyomo.environ as pyo

model = pyo.ConcreteModel()
# Solve model
from pyomo_windows.solvers import SolverManager

solver_manager = SolverManager()
solver = "glpk"  # Or "cbc" or "ipopt"
opt = solver_manager.get_solver(solver)
res = opt.solve(model)
# Process your results...
```
### Troubleshooting
You might face errors in the first execution. 
If in your install you cannot write in the default folder, try
Optionally, if you want models to be downloaded in a different location, than
